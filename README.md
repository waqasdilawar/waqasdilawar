## About Me
I am a software engineer and architect who has spent a large portion of my 5+ year career building distributed platforms on both public clouds. I love working with computers in general, but solving real problems that impact people really makes love my job even more. My experiences and tenure affords me the greatest of opporutnities, and that is mentoring and teaching. I have many courses on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIOiNJquF-ZZ_QvFVdHTImg) and often use my personal GitHub repos to explain software problems and solutions through my exercises.
